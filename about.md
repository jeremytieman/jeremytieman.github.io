Welcome to Codex Machina! My name is Jeremy Tieman. I am a senior research software developer with Microsoft's AI and Research division. This site contains information regarding my personal software and embedded engineering projects as well as articles covering various aspects of computer science and software development that I find useful.

My interests include artificial intelligence (specifically neural networks), cryptography, computer security, operating system development, embedded engineering design and development, compiler development, reverse engineering, and game development. You can view my code on Github.
